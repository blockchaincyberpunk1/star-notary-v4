### General Questions
#### Q1: What is StarNotary DApp?
**A:** StarNotary DApp is a decentralized application that allows users to create, buy, sell, exchange, and transfer unique digital stars on the Ethereum blockchain using ERC-721 tokens.

#### Q2: How do I access the StarNotary DApp?
**A:** The DApp can be accessed through a web browser. Ensure you have an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask installed and connected.

#### Q3: Is there a fee for creating a star?
**A:** Creating a star requires a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, which incurs a gas fee. This fee varies based on network congestion.

### Technical Questions
#### Q1: How do I connect my wallet to the DApp?
**A:** Open the DApp in your browser, click on the 'Connect to MetaMask' button, and follow the prompts in your Ethereum wallet extension (e.g., MetaMask).

#### Q2: Can I buy a star without ETH?
**A:** No, buying a star requires ETH to pay for the star and cover the transaction fees.

#### Q3: What is an ERC-721 token?
**A:** ERC-721 is a standard for representing ownership of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meaning each token is unique and indivisible.

### Troubleshooting
#### Q1: What should I do if my transaction fails?
**A:** Check if you have enough ETH for the transaction and gas fees. If the problem persists, try again later as it might be due to network congestion.

#### Q2: Why can't I see my star after creation?
**A:** Ensure the transaction was successful and wait a few moments as it might take time to update. Refresh the DApp page if necessary.

#### Q3: How do I resolve connectivity issues with MetaMask?
**A:** Ensure that MetaMask is properly installed and that you're connected to the correct network. Restarting your browser or clearing the cache can also help.
