### Blockchain
**Blockchain** is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. It stores information electronically in digital format and is known for its security, transparency, and decentralization.

### Ethereum
**Ethereum** is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (DApps). It features its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH).

### ERC-721 Tokens
**ERC-721 Tokens** are a type of Ethereum token standard that represents unique, non-fungible assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Each ERC-721 token is distinct and can represent ownership of specific items or assets.

### MetaMask
**MetaMask** is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, enabling them to interact with decentralized applications.

### Smart Contract
**Smart Contract** is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into lines of code. They run on the blockchain and automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met.

### Wallet
**Wallet** in blockchain context refers to a digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their cryptocurrencies and tokens. It can be software-based (like MetaMask) or hardware-based.

### Gas Fees
**Gas Fees** are payments made by users to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
**Non-Fungible Token (NFT)** is a type of cryptographic token on a blockchain that represents a unique asset. They can be used to prove ownership of digital items like artworks, collectibles, and in this case, digital stars.

### Decentralized Application (DApp)
**Decentralized Application (DApp)** is an application that runs on a decentralized network, avoiding a single point of failure. DApps are often built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum.

### Transaction
**Transaction** in the context of blockchains, is a record of an exchange of assets between two or more parties. Transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain.
